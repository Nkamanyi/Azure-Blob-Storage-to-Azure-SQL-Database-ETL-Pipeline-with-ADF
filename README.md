## Blob-Storage-to-SQL-Database-ETL-Pipeline-with-Azure-Data-Factory
In this tutorial, I create a data factory by using the Azure Data Factory user interface (UI). The pipeline in this data factory copies data from Azure Blob storage to a database in Azure SQL Database. The configuration pattern in this tutorial applies to copying from a file-based data store to a relational data store.

In this tutorial, I perform the following steps:
- Create a storage account.
- Create a SQL database.
- Create a data factory.
- Create a pipeline with a copy activity.
- Test run the pipeline.
- Trigger the pipeline manually.
- Trigger the pipeline on a schedule.
- Monitor the pipeline and activity runs.
